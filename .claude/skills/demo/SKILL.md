# Demo

The visual test. Unit tests prove the tree; this proves the look.

1. **Load the working copy** in this session (see `live-check` step 1). The new version shows only after the turn that made the edit ends.
2. **Print `docs/demo.md` verbatim as the whole final message of a turn**, with nothing before it and no tool call after it. Claude Code condenses text written right before a tool call, so the demo must close the turn.
3. **The person looks at it**, or screenshots it on the next turn (`live-check` step 3). Check:
   - `prismantis` in a heavy box on the first line, and `Roster` with a heavy rule under it
   - the table: yellow header, rules between rows, the right-aligned `Size` column, colored numbers
   - the four diagrams and the table on one row on a wide terminal, wrapping on a narrow one
   - every flowchart box and sequence participant in its own color, with matching colors at both ends of the sequence
   - a value above each bar, the tallest bar highlighted and the rest muted, labels without quotes, dim gridlines, colored axis numbers
   - shell colors: command, flags, the quoted string, `&&`
   - code blocks with a language header and no frame, and Prism colors in the TypeScript block
   - path, link and inline-code colors, the quote bar, and the green `Tip` alert box
   - with `copyButtons` on, an accent `[ ⧉ copy ]` button on the table, every diagram, the list, the shell block, the alert and the quote
   - the `$$` sum formula as a typeset image with a dim `◰` halfway down beside it in kitty or Ghostty with `ratex-render` installed, a `math` code block elsewhere
4. **Fix what looks wrong**, then run the demo again.
5. **Keep it current.** A new feature adds a line to `docs/demo.md` and to the checklist above. All data stays invented and neutral.
